# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Submission for Module 8 of the University of Birmingham Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development &amp; UX.

This assignment took a starter code package in commit [d6613e6](https://github.com/Stefan4D/weather-dashboard/commit/d6613e6341c012404c59bc77d0c97ab98a07fa54) and developed it to meet the defined acceptance criteria.

The production website is deployed [here](https://stefan4d.github.io/weather-dashboard/).

This has been developed to meet the following Acceptance Criteria:

- Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
- When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
- When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
  - The city name
  - The date
  - An icon representation of weather conditions
  - The temperature
  - The humidity
  - The wind speed
- When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
  - The date
  - An icon representation of weather conditions
  - The temperature
  - The humidity
- When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

## Learning Outcomes

- Revisited using Bootstrap components and utility classes including the built-in grid system
- Practiced using some JSDoc notation for commenting my JavaScript code, which I found very similar to NatSpec with Solidity
- I learned that storing Sets in localStorage doesn't work so need to convert to an array first and then convert back
